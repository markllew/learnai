        <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Programming and Python</h2>
        <p>Welcome to your first module! Here, we'll explore what programming is, why Python is the language of choice for AI, and write our very first lines of code.</p>

        <h3>What is Programming?</h3>
        <p>At its heart, programming is giving instructions to a computer. Think of it like writing a very precise <span class="popout-trigger">recipe<span class="popout-box">A recipe has a list of ingredients (data) and a set of steps (instructions). If a step is ambiguous, like 'cook until done', the result can be unpredictable. Computers need exact instructions!</span></span> for a very literal-minded chef (the computer). These instructions, written in a programming language, tell the computer exactly what to do.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Python for AI?</h3>
        <p>Python has become the dominant language for AI and Machine Learning for several key reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Its syntax is clean and intuitive, making it easier to learn and read.</li>
            <li><strong>Vast Libraries:</strong> Python has powerful, specialized libraries for nearly every AI task (e.g., NumPy for numbers, Pandas for data, Scikit-learn for ML, TensorFlow/PyTorch for Deep Learning).</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Community:</strong> A massive global community means you can find help and resources for almost any problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>
        <p>In programming, we store information in <strong>variables</strong>. Each piece of information has a <strong>data type</strong> that tells the computer what kind of data it is.</p>
        <pre><code># A variable 'name' storing a string (text)
name = "Alice"

# A variable 'age' storing an integer (whole number)
age = 30

# A variable 'height_meters' storing a float (decimal number)
height_meters = 1.75

# A variable 'is_student' storing a boolean (True/False)
is_student = True

print(f"Hello, my name is {name}.")</code></pre>

        <div class="exercise special-box">
            <h3>AI-Proof Exercise: The "100 Years" Program</h3>
            <p>Write a Python script that asks for a user's name and age. Then, it should print a message like: 'Hello [Name], you will be 100 years old in the year [Year].'</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The program must identify if the entered age is unrealistic (e.g., negative or over 120) and provide a thoughtful, non-generic error message instead of crashing. Document your reasoning for handling the 'unrealistic' age with comments in your code.</p>
            <p><strong>Follow-up Challenge:</strong> Extend your program. If the user enters an age that suggests they are already 100 or older, the program should respond with a different, appropriate message. Also, ask for the current year to make the calculation more robust.</p>

        <div class="ethical-spotlight special-box">
            <h3>Ethical Spotlight: Data Privacy</h3>
            <p>Even this simple program asks for personal data (name and age). Consider: Where could this data be stored? Who might access it? It's a fundamental principle of ethical software design to be transparent with users about what data you collect and why, even for the smallest applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context special-box">
            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, famously captured in the "Zen of Python" (try typing <code>import this</code> into a Python interpreter!).</p>
